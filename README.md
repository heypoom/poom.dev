# Poom.dev: Poom's Website and Digital Garden

Welcome!

This is Poom.dev, my personal site and digital garden.

## How does it work

- Markdown resides in my private notes repository.
  - This makes the whole site content easy to edit in Obsidian.
  - Yep, this is horribly inefficient but it's a first MVP!

## Philosophy

- My website is a **filtered view** of my digital garden.
  - I don't want to separate my website content with my digital garden. The source of truth for everything resides in my digital garden for ease of editing and publishing.
  - Most of the content in my digital garden is private. Therefore, I only publish markdown notes where the frontmatter contains `public: true`
