# Poom.dev: Poom's Website and Digital Garden

Welcome!

This is Poom.dev, my personal site and digital garden.

## How does it work

- Markdown resides in my private notes repository.
  - This makes the whole site content easy to edit in Obsidian.
  - Yep, this is horribly inefficient but it's a first MVP!

- Private notes in my markdown is filtered.
