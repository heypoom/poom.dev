I'm Poom, a software engineer from Bangkok, Thailand.
Nice to meet you üëãüèª

I've co-founded [Creatorsgarten](https://creatorsgarten.org), a collective of creators and software engineers with love of hacking, creativity, and interdisciplinary thinking.

We have co-organized [33 events](https://creatorsgarten.org/events) together, consisting of meetups, hackathons, camps, and workshops.

The first event I organized was the [stupid hackathon bangkok](https://stupidhackth.github.io) back in 2017. Our team have been co-hosting it since for <YearsSinceDate d={30} m={9} y={2017} offset={1} /> years straight:

I [dropped out of high school](/story) <YearsSinceDate d={17} m={11} y={2016} /> years ago to pursue my love for software engineering and building products.

I love [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and prefer working with Linux and
terminal environments. I love Neovim and Tmux. Take a look at [my dotfiles](https://github.com/heypoom/dotfiles) and my various customizations.

I am primarily a web developer; I build frontend apps in React, although I've been trying out Vue, Astro, and Svelte in my new projects. I'm learning Rust, Kotlin, Clojure, and Elixir.

I have been active in Thai developer communities since 2015. I've given [over 30 talks](/talks) at conferences and meetups.

On the fun side, I love plushies, onsen baths, Japanese cuisine,
Macarons, photography, the sea, the mountains, trekking, camping, swimming, running, and jet skiing.

During weekends, you can find me jogging in parks, reading books in cafes, relaxing in onsen baths, visiting art galleries, and taking photos at places near the Chao Phraya river.
